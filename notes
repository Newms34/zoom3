TO DO:
write ban code/ui
can get user IP from socket.handshake.address, and add that to list of banned 'users'.
can we send an event to just that user (i.e., 'LOL B&')?


FOR OVER-REFRESHING $scope.allUsers:
on opening admin panel, copy $scope.allUser's data into temp (unchanging) object.
on clicking ban/unban, send to BACK END
Back end sends forward to front end.
On receive front end, change BOTH temp obj from above AND $scope.allUser!

-NEED TO CHANGE adminpanel toggle to a function, not ternary operator! (since fn needs to update temp object)

if not focused on main window, do (slightly longer) beep?
